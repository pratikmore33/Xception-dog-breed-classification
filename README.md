# Xception Dog Breed Classification

This repository contains code for dog breed classification using transfer learning with the Xception model.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform multiclass classification of dog breeds. The target variable consists of 10 different dog breeds. The dataset used for training the model is available on Kaggle and is called "Dog Nose Breed". In addition to the dataset, we utilize the Xception model, a pre-trained model from Keras applications, as the base model for feature extraction. 

## Model Architecture

We employ transfer learning by utilizing the Xception model's pre-trained weights. We extract features from the base model and connect it to a fully connected layer for classification. The Adam optimizer is used along with categorical cross-entropy loss as the loss metric, and the accuracy metric is used for model evaluation. 

To ensure that the model can handle various real-life inputs, data augmentation techniques are implemented during training. Detailed plots of loss and accuracy over the training period are provided for visual analysis. Additionally, a confusion matrix is presented to provide further clarity on the classification performance of the model.

Please refer to the code in this repository for the implementation details.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the "Dog Nose Breed" dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the requirements file.
4. Execute the code to train and evaluate the model.
5. Analyze the results, including the loss and accuracy plots and the confusion matrix, for model performance.

Feel free to modify and customize the code according to your needs and dataset.
